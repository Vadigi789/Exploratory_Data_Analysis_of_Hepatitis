#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Hepatitis Dataset
The EDA process for the hepatitis dataset involved understanding the data’s structure, detecting data quality issues, and identifying key patterns before applying machine learning. We began by loading the dataset and checking column data types, null values, and basic statistics (mean, median, mode, min, max, standard deviation). Missing values in numerical features were treated based on skewness: for features with skewness between -0.5 and +0.5, we used the mean; for highly skewed features, we used the median to reduce outlier influence. Missing values in categorical variables were imputed using the mode.
Outlier detection was performed using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method, and extreme values were treated accordingly to prevent distortion in analysis and modeling. The skewness was rechecked post-treatment to ensure balanced distribution. For categorical variables like gender, One-Hot Encoding was applied, dropping one dummy column to avoid redundancy. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and countplots were used to understand feature distributions, class imbalances, and relationships between variables. This process ensured the dataset was clean, well-structured, and ready for model training.
